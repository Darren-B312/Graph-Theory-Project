## Introduction <a name="introduction"/>
Welcome to my repository! I am a third-year software development student at GMIT. As part of a Graph Theory module, I was tasked with building a regular expression engine using python. Though my project is relatively primitive when compared with existing regex implementations, it was still a considerable challenge and involved a solid understanding of the underlying concepts to develop. In this overview I will attempt to explain and describe, in detail, the following:

 - Running // How to setup and use my code to check if a string of characters matches a regex
 - Tests // My testing strategy for this project and how you can run those tests
 - Algorithms // The fundamental graph theory and computer science algorithms behind the code
 - References // Sources used during research and development of this project

A major requirement from the project brief is that this overview be pitched at second year computer science students. As such, I will assume that anyone reading this has a decent understanding of programming languages but not specifically python.
